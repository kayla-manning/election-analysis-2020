### Importance of Ground Game in Voter Turnout

### Turnout in 2020

Lower turnout due to COVID-19 and widespread voting by mail? Or [record-breaking](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/2020-election-turnout/616640/) turnout?
- Primaries are the best predictor we have for voting in a pandemic
- states that made an effort to encourage people to vote by mail experienced impressive [success](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-have-been-38-statewide-elections-during-the-pandemic-heres-how-they-went/). states mailing every voter an absentee ballot saw the greatest share of votes cast absentee. States not mailing anything to encourage or requiring an excuse to vote absentee had the lowest share of absentee voting.
- however, primaries generally have lower turnout (3%-46%) than general elections (~60%), so it's not a perfect comparison. Fortunately, examining primary turnout reveals that COVID-19 did not drastically decrease turnout rates.

Predicted [66%] before COVID-19 even existed (https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2019-09-20/experts-predict-huge-turnout-in-2020) turnout for 2020 last year. Experts still consistently predict [65%](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/520313-experts-predict-record-election-turnout-as-more-than-66-million-ballots) turnout


#### How [FiveThirtyEight's Forecast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/) Deals with Unpredictability

- attempts to account for less predictable turnout due to COVID-19 & resulting uncertainty in Election Day Results
- accounts for relative ease of voting in each state (generally, leads to higher turnout and more Democratic votes)
- national snapshot that projects voter turnout by state using population growth since 2016, changes in relative ease of voting since 2016, and the current closeness of the race (tends to be higher turnout in closer-polling states)
- turnout in primaries hard to predict due to COVID-19: made easier by expanded voting by mail but harder by difficulty with social distancing in person
    - examine which states allow voting by mail & which don't - higher turnout in those with expanded voting by mail?
    - turnout was ~50% higher in primaries after COVID-19 came to US than before
    - states with drastic change in turnout between cycles are harder to forecast
        - estimated 50% increase in error when predicting turnout -> 20% increase in error when predicting vote share for each party
- as a result of the above & due to how COVID-19 could affect turnout and the voting process, 538 increased Election Day error, correlated state error, and state-specific error by 20% relative to typical values

#### How the [Economist Forecast](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president/how-this-works) Adjusts for Turnout: Polling Biases

##### Polling Bias
Polls conducted on all adults will inevitably include the views of people that will not vote in the general election, which introduces biases regarding voter turnout. Pollsters attempt to mend this by strategically weighting the responses of individuals likely to vote, but this introduces another layer of bias unique to that pollster's method. 

Over time, different pollsters will conduct surveys in the same areas, and the Economist's model compares the results of these different polls on similar populations and adjusts for the differences.

### Looking Ahead

- uncertain impact on turnout due to the shock of COVID-19... turnout is only one of the factors impacted by the pandemic. Retrospective voting raises the question of how voters may punish/reward the incumbent for the handling not only of COVID-19, but also of wildfires, hurricanes, racial injustice protests, and more. moving forward to examine shocks next week
