# Introduction: The Economy's Role in Elections
## September 19, 2020

#### Overview

Research suggests that voters tend to reward incumbents for short-term economic conditions, typically within 6 months to 1 year from election day.[^short-term] 

#### Model 1 : Incumbency Status and Q2 GDP Growth

While the literature suggests that voters reward the incumbent party for short-term economic conditions, how does this vary among sitting presidents seeking re-election and same-party heirs seeking the office? The below plot indicates that the relationship between Q2 GDP Growth and two-party vote share does differ depending on incumbency status:

An [exploratory analysis](../figures/economy.ggpairs.jpeg) of the economic variables in the [data](../data/econ.csv)[^data] revealed that Q2 GDP growth has the highest correlation with two-party vote share for the incumbent party. After testing numerous variables with an interaction term for incumbency status, the strongest model that observed the interaction between incumbency and an economic variable examined the interaction between election-year Q2 GDP growth and incumbency status of candidates in the incumbent party. While the [regression](../figures/int_gdp_reg.html) does not reveal a significant relationship between the interaction of incumbency status with GDP growth, it does detect that on average, an incumbent candidate's two-party vote share increases by approximately 2.2 percentage points for every percentage increase in Q2 GDP growth.

To test the out-of-sample fit for this model, I wrote a function that built a model excluding a single election year and found the residual by finding the difference between the actual two-party vote share and the two-party vote share predicted by the model. After repeating this for all election years in the data, the residual plot displays no clear pattern in the residuals, with the model predicting most elections within 5 percentage points:

After building the model and assessing the out-of-sample fit, I put the model to the test with 2020 data. While Q2 numbers typically serve as a good indicator for voting patterns in election years, the COVID-19 pandemic brought historic lows for the US economy. While incumbency status typically boosts vote share, this simple model based on the economy did do much in the way of helping out Trump and predicted that he would only win approximately **18.4%** of the popular vote.

#### Model 2: 

While some people feel frustrated about Donald Trump's performance, no one realistically expects such a landslide election. However, focusing on economics limits the scope of what is possible when creating a model that fits for previous elections while forecasting a reasonable outcome for 2020. In an attempt to find something more realistic for 2020, I looked to long-term economic indicators.


#### Limitations

By mid-March, COVID-19 had reached all [50 states](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e4.htm). While Q2 economic numbers ordinarily serve as good predictors for presidential elections, real GDP decreased at an annual rate of [32.9%](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2020-advance-estimate-and-annual-update) in the second quarter. Q3 numbers might lend themselves to slightly more realistic models, but those numbers are not available yet. The below visualization, which replicates a similar graphic from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html), displays GDP growth in Q2 relative to the previous quarter, beginning in 1947:

The unprecedented economic situation brought by COVID-19 makes economic data less reliable when predicting this 2020 election. On top of the unusual circumstances of 2020, forecasters must work with a limited sample size in less unusual election years as well. While the US has only held 58 presidential elections in its history, the GDP data dates back to 1947 and only accounts for 18 elections. Exploring individual subcategories, such as incumbency status in Model 1, only exacerbates this issue.

It is not reasonable to wish for a larger sample size to improve the models presented. However, adding non-economic variables to the model in future weeks will lead to a more realistic look at the outcome of the 2020 election. Even in years without such economic volatility, most election forecasters incorporated a mixture of political and economic indicators in their models.[^symposium]
