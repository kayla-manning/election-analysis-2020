## October 24, 2020

### What the Literature Says about Shocks
- tornadoes only with economic damage
- irrationality in shark attacks have largely been disproven
- even if voters were behaving irrationally, polls should capture that

### The Impact of COVID-19 on the 2020 Election
- correlated with approval
- economic numbers definitely reflect COVID damage
