Welcome to my election analysis blog! I will post updates every Saturday. Feel free to reach out to me ([kaylamanning@college.harvard.edu](kaylamanning@college.harvard.edu)) if you have any comments or questions.

# [Final Prediction](posts/final.md)
**THIS IS A DRAFT. COME BACK AFTER 9 PM EST ON 11/1 FOR THE FINAL PREDICTION.**

The following posts analyze various components of presidential elections and provide updated predictions for the 2020 race. Each post ultimately informed the modeling decisions in my final prediction:

## [1. Introduction](posts/intro.md)
As the 2020 election approaches, this first blog post looks to past elections to explore electoral swing in battleground states between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.

## [2. Economy](posts/economy.md)
Economic conditions predict elections fairly well, but how does that translate to 2020 in the midst of an economic crisis brought on by a global pandemic? Also, does the relationship between vote share and economic conditions vary between incumbent candidates and new candidates from the incumbent party? This post explores three different models that investigate these questions.

## [3. Polling](posts/polling.md)
This installment incorporates poll numbers in updated predictions, explores the accuracy of polls across sources, and compares two approaches taken by professional forecasters.

## [4. Incumbency](posts/incumbency.md)
More often than not, incumbent presidents win their re-election bids. Incumbent candidates enjoy a large set of structural advantages that collectively form the *incumbency advantage*. Can Trump's status as an incumbent carry him to a victory in 2020? 

## [5. Advertising](posts/ads.md)
This analysis examines political advertising on various media platforms and takes a look the relative advertising strategies of candidates in battleground states.

## [6. Voter Turnout](posts/turnout.md)
How do experts anticipate COVID-19 affecting voter turnout? This post considers possible effects of COVID-19 on turnout, explores how different forecasters account for the resulting variability, and looks at models that simulate fluctuations in turnout.

## [7. The Impact of COVID-19](posts/shocks.md)
After a brief exploration of the relationship between COVID-19 and polls, an updated model provides state-by-state predictions.
